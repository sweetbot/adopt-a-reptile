## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
The UI of this app is written in JetPack Compose.

The UI is greatly inspired by various official Android demo apps https://github.com/android/compose-samples/.

You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features. https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation

Pleasantly applied various Material Design themings, such as dark mode, using Jetpack Compose Theming: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes

In this app, there are 2 tabs, the first tab is for browsing all the available reptiles. The second tab is for saving reptiles in user's favorites for later decision as which one to adopt. The second tab is still WIP.

There is a staggered grid in the first tab. When clicking an item in the first tab, a new detail page for that item appears. At the bottom of the detail page, there is a new list, each item can lead to a detail page too.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Captive-born reptiles are beautiful and make great pets in an increasingly fast-paced world. They are new stars in the pet industry. Because they are easy to breed, many people would like to share the joy of taking care of reptiles with more people, while focusing their love on a few ones. Every pet reptile deserves good care in a good family.

If you are interested in bringing this app to life, feel free to contact me for code collaboration, or sharing product ideas.
